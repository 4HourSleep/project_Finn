Description:
"Dopp3lgänger" is a unique browser-based visual novel game centered around the story of the protagonist, Klesinister Y. This original character is a complex and mysterious being with a rich background and multi-layered personality. The story takes place in a virtual mental asylum, where players, through observing and making choices for Klesinister Y, explore their inner world and the secrets of their past.
The game is designed around player choices, where each decision significantly influences the narrative, leading to various possible endings. This interactivity not only enhances the sense of immersion but also allows players to shape the story's direction through their actions.
"Klesinister Y: Visual Novel" is developed entirely using web technologies, including p5.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This combination of tools ensures cross-platform compatibility, allowing the game to run smoothly on most modern browsers, while also providing the developers with greater creative freedom. p5.js powers the rich graphical elements of the game, HTML and CSS provide the structure and design of the interface, and JavaScript handles the interactive logic and dynamic behavior.
The game's visual and narrative style is distinct and innovative. The design of the virtual mental asylum draws heavy influence from retro internet art and postmodern aesthetics, using abstract and symbolic scenes to evoke intense emotional atmospheres. Every scene is carefully crafted, from the cold, clinical nature of the asylum to the complex depths of the protagonist's psychological world, providing players with an immersive sensory experience.
Additionally, the game incorporates many personalized elements, such as the protagonist's signature blue and red color scheme and virtual punk style, presenting a vivid and tense virtual world. Through these visual and narrative details, "Klesinister Y: Visual Novel" is not just a game, but a work of art, allowing players to experience profound emotional resonance and intellectual stimulation while enjoying the gameplay.
